								<h4> 1. Combine your eggs and egg yolk in a bowl.</h4>
								<h4> 2. Next, add 4 ounces of grated cheese. Stir with a fork to combine. Season with fresh black pepper.</h4>
								<h4> 3. Slice ½ pound of thick-cut bacon into large chunks.</h4>
								<h4> 4. Add the sliced bacon to a cold nonstick pan and then turn the heat to medium. </h4>
								<h4> 5. Once the bacon is fully cooked and the fat has rendered out, strain out the grease, keeping only 2 tablespoons of fat in the pan.</h4>
								<h4> 6. Return the pan to medium-low heat and add minced garlic. Saute for one minute and then turn off the heat.</h4>
								<h4> 7. Add bucatini noodles to a pot of heavily salted water and cook to desired done-ness.</h4>

								<h4>**Speaker 1** [00:01:19] I think it's just very creamy and I like how you cook. The pasta is like all done. Is that the word? Yeah. It's like it's not too soft. It's very firm but chewy in a way. So can you tell me, can you walk me through how you would cook carbonara?</h4>

								<h4>**Speaker 2** [00:01:39] Sure. So I first was interested in cooking carbonara. I saw it on a Netflix show. Hmm. And in the show, the character actually goes through and makes the carbonara from scratch. So it got me interested in cooking it because it was kind of a different cooking process than other pasta. So anyway, to start cooking carbonara, you have a little you have some options or what kind of pasta you can use. Hmm. You could do something basic, like spaghetti. There are also some more interesting noodles that you could use, like bucatini, but I typically just do spaghetti because that's what I have at home. Mm. Obviously, it would be better if you could make it from scratch, but I don't have the pasta itself. Yeah, but I don't have room in my kitchen to make the pasta dough because you need a large work area where you can get very messy.</h4>

								<h4>**Speaker 1** [00:02:29] Yeah. Have you ever cook pasta like from scratch before?</h4>

								<h4>**Speaker 2** [00:02:32] I have not. No, but I would love to one day anyway. Other than that, the ingredients that you're going to need to cook carbonara. You're going to need a pound of spaghetti noodles or whatever kind of noodles you use 16 ounces of noodles. The most important ingredient is going to be your eggs, so you need four eggs in total. You also need some sort of fatty pork. So traditionally, carbonara is cooked with one Charlie. That is an Italian type of fatty pork.</h4>

								<h4>**Speaker 1** [00:03:05] When you say fatty pork, is it bacon or is just the fat part of?</h4>

								<h4>**Speaker 2** [00:03:10] Well, yeah, bacon is would be a type of fatty pork because basically what you're wanting for the pasta is the fat. OK, so which we'll get more into that later. But one chocolate is just a different kind of pork, and its prepared a little differently. But yeah, it's very similar to bacon. You probably couldn't even tell a difference. OK. So I typically use bacon because I don't I don't have access to go on challah plus bacon. You can use it for more things in the kitchen. So you're half a pound of bacon. Sometimes I like to add a little extra because I really enjoy the flavor of the bacon. Yeah. Plus, I also like to add more cheese, which will get into that. But you need more fat to balance out the cheese. So it will emulsify. So four ounces of cheese you can do Pecorino Romano or Parmigiano Reggiano. I typically stick with a Parmesan just because I have more of that. And the only thing I would use pecorino for would be the carbonara. </h4>
								<h4>**Speaker 1** [00:04:07] What's what's the difference between Parmesan and the and the other one?</h4>

								<h4>**Speaker 2** [00:04:12] I'm probably the worst person to ask, but they're both very similar.</h4>

								<h4>**Speaker 2** [00:04:17] And I've had pecorino before, but I don't remember the taste difference between the two.</h4>

								<h4>**Speaker 1** [00:04:23] No, I was just wondering.</h4>

								<h4>**Speaker 2** [00:04:24] Go ahead. They have similar applications. They're both very dry cheeses. They taste similar, kind of salty.</h4>

								<h4>**Speaker 1** [00:04:32] Hmm. OK.</h4>

								<h4>**Speaker 2** [00:04:33] So you need four ounces of cheese. But I usually do more and I don't weigh everything out. When I do the cheese, I just kind of do it. I feel like if I have a block of parmesan, I'll probably just use the rest of the block as what I do. Ground black pepper, very important. Freshly ground black pepper. Not to canned stuff. Mm hmm. Kosher salt.</h4>

								<h4> **Speaker 1** [00:04:53] So you will have like a grinder and you will</h4>

								<h4> **Speaker 2** [00:04:56] always look always for everything. And then while we're cooking. The noodles. We're going to remove half a cup of the starchy pasta water, which will help finish our dish. But it's important I</h4>

								<h4> **Speaker 1** [00:05:09] move half a cup from the pot. </h4>

								<h4> **Speaker 2** [00:05:12] Yes, when the pasta is almost done.</h4>

								<h4> **Speaker 1** [00:05:14] OK.</h4>

								<h4> **Speaker 2** [00:05:14] Important to remember that because if you're like me, you'll forget and then you'll end up pouring all your pasta water out. Yeah, you get it back once it's down the drain.</h4>

								<h4> **Speaker 1** [00:05:23] So what's the what if you use just like water, would that make a difference?</h4>

								<h4> **Speaker 2** [00:05:28] You'd probably have to put cornstarch in the water you need a thickening agent is the whole purpose of the starchy pasta water. OK. Yeah, that's corn. Corn starch being a starts</h4>

								<h4> **Speaker 1** [00:05:39] rye, so you need half a cup of pasta water</h4>

								<h4> **Speaker 2** [00:05:44] saved when again, you may not use all of it. You're just kind of looking for the feel of it.</h4>

								<h4> **Speaker 1** [00:05:48] Hmm. OK.</h4>

								<h4> **Speaker 2** [00:05:50] So anyway, to get started, I like to get all of my ingredients set up before I start cooking, which is called mise en place is a French word, meaning everything in its place so that while you're cooking, you don't have to worry about grinding your cheese, cracking your eggs, anything like that. So it makes the cooking process a lot easier, especially with a dish like carbonara, because once you're at the stage that you're making your sauce, things get a little more intense and you're not going to have time to not pay attention to your pan.</h4>

								<h4> **Speaker 1** [00:06:18] You have to move very quickly.</h4>

								<h4> **Speaker 2** [00:06:19] That's right. Or you or you'll break your sauce. And then after that you'd have to start over. Or it'd be like scrambled eggs and spaghetti, which is now what we're going for. Mhm. So, yeah, so you'll cut up your bacon or you're going chocolate. If you have access to that, you'll just cut it into small cubes or small strips. Set that aside. And then in a bowl, a large bowl, like a mixing bowl like you'd use for cake or something, you're going to grate all of your cheese. Mm hmm. You're also going to take your four eggs. You're going to remove the egg yolk from one mm. So you'll just have the protein yellow part. Yeah. And then you'll put the the entire part of the three large eggs in the bowl with</h4>

								<h4> **Speaker 1** [00:07:05] three large eggs of four</h4>

								<h4> **Speaker 2** [00:07:06] yolks, no. Three large eggs and one four eggs in total. OK. This is going to go in the bowl. After that, we're going to grate all of our cheese, which is our parmesan. Or, like I said, if you have access to Pecorino, you could probably mix the two two if you wanted to. And then we're going to mix this up with the eggs and turn it into almost like a pancake batter is the consistency that it will be.</h4>

								<h4> **Speaker 1** [00:07:30] So it's kind of thick.</h4>

								<h4> **Speaker 2** [00:07:32] It's pretty thick. Yeah. So we're going to mix that really well. And then what I like to do, I put that in the fridge because I don't want it to get warm while I'm cooking. And I remember</h4>

								<h4> **Speaker 1** [00:07:43] reading the salt</h4>

								<h4> **Speaker 2** [00:07:44] or the eggs and the cheese. I don't want that to get room temperature. Why? Two reasons. First, I remember reading that any time you're making like a gravy or a source or an emulsion, you want to put cold things into the warm pan to stop the cooking process. So if my eggs are warm, there's a greater chance that one it will break and it will turn into a sauce. I'll have scrambled eggs and spaghetti, which is what I don't want to just for safety reasons. I don't want eggs getting room temperature before I put those kind of gross.</h4>

								<h4> **Speaker 1** [00:08:16] Right? OK.</h4>

								<h4> **Speaker 2** [00:08:18] So yes, we'll mix that. We'll put that in the fridge, the bacon we can leave out, because that's going to be the first thing that we put in the pan. I'm also going to add some pepper. I should have said this before. I'm going to add some of the grated pepper into the egg and cheese mixture, so that'll be in the fridge waiting for us. So then we will get our spaghetti boiling and just read the box on how long it'll take, and it kind of depends on how quick your stove is. So we're going to take a big pot of water and we're going to salt that until it is as salty as the ocean, really?</h4>

								<h4> **Speaker 1** [00:08:55] Mm hmm. So you have to taste it.</h4>

								<h4> **Speaker 2** [00:08:58] I usually don't. I usually just eyeball it. I just put it in a lot of salt. OK, and then we'll also add a little bit of olive oil to the pasta water as well, so the noodles don't stick to each other.</h4>

								<h4> **Speaker 1** [00:09:08] I yeah, I heard if you put olive oil in the pasta water, the noodles are going to get very like they won't stick to each other. But also the sauce that you're going to put later on won't stick on them. Is that true?</h4>

								<h4> **Speaker 2** [00:09:21] I don't know. I've never heard that. I know traditionally, though, I've always tried to put the olive oil in the past. Water could just be a traditional thing that does nothing. Okay. Yeah. So we'll get the pasta going and boiling. While the pasta is cooking, we will take the bacon and we will put it into a cold frying pan so we would fry. So we will not preheat the frying pan like we would normally do if we were going to sear a protein. So we will then increase the temperature to medium on the frying pan because we're not trying to so much cook the bacon. We're trying to render out the fat from the pork. So we want a pan full of. It's bacon, but more importantly, we want to plan for oil, pork fat. Yeah, the oil. So, you know, you just have to eyeball that probably take about five to 10 minutes in my experience.</h4>

								<h4> **Speaker 1** [00:10:13] And the heat stay on medium.</h4>

								<h4> **Speaker 2** [00:10:15] Yeah, I don't ever increase it. OK. We're kind of wanting a slow, slow process. We're not trying to cook the bacon fast, which we do want the bacon crispy, though we don't want boiled eggs.</h4>

								<h4> **Speaker 1** [00:10:26] How do you make the bacon crispy? If the heat is always,</h4>

								<h4> **Speaker 2** [00:10:30] it takes longer.</h4>

								<h4> **Speaker 1** [00:10:32] Eventually, OK? Yup.</h4>

								<h4> **Speaker 2** [00:10:36] So yeah, so we'll start cooking that bacon and let that fat render out. We'll have our noodles cooking at the same time. Now, once the noodles are all Dante or just before they feel like they're done, we're going to remove them. And be sure to remove our half a cup of pasta water before we pour out our noodles. And I don't just mean that it's not quite done, but we're going to finish them in the pan so we don't want them to be done because they're still going to cook.</h4>

								<h4> **Speaker 1** [00:11:01] Does that mean if the pasta boxes and needs to be boiled for, like 10 minutes, you take them out before they're like nine minutes to make sure it's not fully cooked?</h4>

								<h4> **Speaker 2** [00:11:10] Yeah, that's what I would do. And I usually just use the box as an estimate because everybody's ranges cook at different temperatures like my kitchen is very slow. Yeah. So really, I mean, you just have to take the pasta out of the water and kind of taste it. So, yes, so at this point, our noodles will be done. We'll have our half a cup of pasta water or have our noodles on a calendar strained. Sometimes I will even add a little bit of olive oil to the noodles while they're in the calendar and mix them, because if the noodles cool in the calendar, they'll all stick together.</h4>

								<h4> **Speaker 1** [00:11:45] It's like a big chunk, correct?</h4>

								<h4> **Speaker 2** [00:11:47] Which is just something I do now. You only have to do that if you're if you're waiting for something to get done. So if our controller or our bacon is ready and all the fat is rendered out, we don't have to do that. We can just drain it and then throw it straight into the bacon and the Guan challah. So that'll be our next. We'll add the noodles, and with the pork fat and the bacon, we'll let them get to know each other. We want to increase that. He will leave them on medium still. Once that's nice and incorporated, we will turn the heat down. Sometimes I'll even turn it off. So this is the part in the recipe where you kind of have to experiment and get your own level of comfort because we're going to add the egg and cheese mixture in with the noodles and the bacon fat. But we're not trying to cook the eggs. Like I've been saying, we don't want scrambled eggs and spaghetti.</h4>

								<h4> **Speaker 1** [00:12:39] So the eggs will not be fully cooked. It would just like be like a sauce, like a correct.</h4>

								<h4> **Speaker 2** [00:12:45] Yeah. I mean, we are going to warm it, but we're not trying to get the egg to form any curds or to thicken up, right?</h4>

								<h4> **Speaker 1** [00:12:53] OK.</h4>

								<h4> **Speaker 2** [00:12:54] But we do want to warm it and get it up to temperature.</h4>

								<h4> **Speaker 1** [00:12:58] Are all eggs safe enough to eat when it's not fully cooked?</h4>

								<h4> **Speaker 2** [00:13:02] Yes. Which these these are not raw</h4>

								<h4> **Speaker 1** [00:13:05] eggs right there.</h4>

								<h4> **Speaker 2** [00:13:06] They're still going to be safe to eat.</h4>

								<h4> **Speaker 1** [00:13:08] OK. Yeah.</h4>

								<h4> **Speaker 2** [00:13:10] So, yeah, so we'll take our pan. What I do is I take the pan off the heat until I'm comfortable that my pan is not too hot because we can always incorporate more heat if we need to. So we'll add the egg and cheese mixture to the pan, all of it, and we will quickly mix it around in the pan with the pork fat, with the noodles just to make sure that it's getting all incorporated. So we'll let that get to know each other. At this point. You're going to know if you need more heat because you can see if your egg is raw or if it's nice and emulsified what?</h4>

								<h4> **Speaker 1** [00:13:43] How do you define it? It's like done. If it's I know how it's raw egg, I know how it ROG look like.</h4>

								<h4> **Speaker 2** [00:13:51] But what kind of you would see that the eggs weren't so runny? And we're all looking in the sauce and they'd be more thick and they'd be more incorporated into the noodles so that when we start our noodles, the sauce will stick to the noodles and we won't see raw egg dispersing in the pan. OK, that makes sense.</h4>

								<h4> **Speaker 1** [00:14:10] Yeah, yeah, I want to see them all mixed together.</h4>

								<h4> **Speaker 2** [00:14:13] I want to sit in Iceland emulsified. So yeah, so at this point, like I said, you know, if you need more heat, I usually need a little more heat just to get the sauce where I want it, because I like a creamy thick sauce because we're really looking for that thick protein flavor is what we're going for. We want a really strong flavor that the eggs and the cheese and everything gets us. So there's two ways to incorporate the heat back into the dish. The easiest thing is just going to be dislodge or you're paying back onto the burner that you were using before, and you can slowly increase heat from low to medium to see what you need. You're going to be quickly stirring this as you go. If you do see the eggs, start to sit up and form curds. All you have to do is take it back off the heat.</h4>

								<h4> **Speaker 1** [00:14:57] Yeah, OK.</h4>

								<h4> **Speaker 2** [00:14:59] Another way to incorporate heat back. Into the dish, this will be the safer way, but it takes a little more effort instead of straining your pasta water off, what she could do is take tongs and remove the noodles from the pot of boiling water and put it into the pan straight from the boiling water into the pan. Saving your boiling water. And so what you can do is create sort of a makeshift double boiler like what is used to melt chocolate and candy.</h4>

								<h4> **Speaker 1** [00:15:26] Is that what you did the other day? Yeah.</h4>

								<h4> **Speaker 2** [00:15:28] So it's it's a safer way. Some more gentle way to incorporate heat into a dish because you're heating the pan with steam. You're not heating the pan with conduction.</h4>

								<h4> **Speaker 1** [00:15:37] So it's more gentle.</h4>

								<h4> **Speaker 2** [00:15:38] It's more gentle. It's easier to control the temperature. So that's another way to do it.</h4>

								<h4> **Speaker 1** [00:15:42] How is that easier? Because the steam is going to eventually get cold? It can't be any hotter than when you first start,</h4>

								<h4> **Speaker 2** [00:15:49] right when you leave the boiler on. Oh, OK. You'll keep boiling water, OK? And so all you have to do to reduce the if you see that your eggs are getting curds and they're cooking too quickly and you're getting scrambled eggs, all you have to do is remember the pan from the steam. OK, so it's just a safer way to do it. OK. So, yeah, so now once we've got the sauce where we like it, we're pretty much done at this point. We could incorporate or during that process, we could incorporate that starchy pasta water if we think that it needs it to make it a little more thick. Always add just a little bit just for the salt content, honestly, because you've seasoned that pasta water, you know, so you don't have to add salt.</h4>

								<h4> **Speaker 1** [00:16:27] Would that be enough salt for the for the.</h4>

								<h4> **Speaker 2** [00:16:30] I would think so what you're going to taste? You know, you're going to salt and pepper to taste. So you add</h4>

								<h4> **Speaker 1** [00:16:35] salt and pepper at the last always. OK? Yeah, yeah.</h4>

								<h4> **Speaker 2** [00:16:42] So, yeah, so now we can plate it up. I like to eat it off of a plate instead of a bowl and instead of a bowl. Mm hmm. And then you can always add a little extra parmesan or pecorino on top if you want to. Hmm. And that's a winner.</h4>

								<h4> **Speaker 1** [00:16:56] You know how long the entire process usually takes.</h4>

								<h4> **Speaker 2** [00:16:59] And the hardest part, honestly, it's grating the cheese. So you're going to spend it, which is true of most things that you cook. You're going to spend more time getting all of your ingredients in your mise en place to set up. Yeah. And then you're just honestly, you're just waiting for the pasta to cook. Hmm. The most the most technically difficult part is knowing if your eggs are getting too hot or if they're too cold, because like I said, if you scramble your eggs, you're there's nothing you can do to undo that. Or if your eggs are raw, all you have to do is incorporate a little more heat</h4>

								<h4> **Speaker 1** [00:17:32] in order not to break the salt. You can't add any water or anything after</h4>

								<h4> **Speaker 2** [00:17:39] you could have the start to pasta water. Yeah, and just slowly incorporate it and start into the dish because the starch is going to thicken that water when it's heated.</h4>

								<h4> **Speaker 1** [00:17:49] Okay. How do you define break the break the sauce? Like, what do you mean by the salt as the</h4>

								<h4> **Speaker 2** [00:17:56] if you break a sauce? The oil has separated from the emulsion, if that makes any sense, so your salt</h4>

								<h4> **Speaker 1** [00:18:03] oil would be from</h4>

								<h4> **Speaker 2** [00:18:05] the fat, from the fat. Yeah. So you're you'll notice that your sauce is not homogeneous. It's not one mixture. It's like oil and sauce, and they're just not talking to each other. You've got two things in the pan and set of one emulsified sauce. Mm.</h4>

								<h4> **Speaker 1** [00:18:21] OK, so that's pretty much how you make carbonara.</h4>

								<h4> **Speaker 2** [00:18:27] There's probably other ways to make it. That's the way I'm most comfortable with making it for about five years. Hmm.</h4>
