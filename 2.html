								<p> Aaron talked about what he likes to cook. </p>
								<p> I enjoy cooking a lot. I like to cook carbonara, gumbo, steak, and potatoes. My favorite thing to cook is probably steak and potatoes because It's not very difficult, but it's very tasty and filling. Also, just like the taste of beef. </p>
