								<h4> An American fusion. That's part of just trying to think of things you can tweak because one of the good things about it is there's not a lot of ingredients bacon, egg, cheese, noodles, rye. There may be a way that you can prepare it with rice. Maybe you do rice or potatoes instead of your noodle because I can't. I don't think you can change the sauce much. I can't think of a way because then it would be carbonara. I guess I'm American. You can put it over french fries. I think Naoki would be a thing that would be more interesting to the fusion because you could do it like the Korean rice cake dish instead of the rice cake. It's no deal. And so you would do the Naoki balls like you do Italian, but the sauce would be the straight up rice cake. Plus, the identity of the gnocchi dish is the potato bowl. It's not so much the sauce or as carbonara. The identity of the dish is the sauce. It's not it's not the noodle. </h4>

								<h4> **Speaker 1** [00:24:52] And if this is if you're the chef at the restaurant and this is like a fusion restaurant, you can be creative with the dish. Would you add anything to carbonara? Just to make it like not a traditional dish?</h4>

								<h4>**Speaker 2** [00:25:08] That's a good question. I guess it depends on who I'm fuzing with,</h4>

								<h4>**Speaker 1** [00:25:11] just for your own interests,</h4>

								<h4>**Speaker 2** [00:25:12] just like an American fusion.</h4>

								<h4>**Speaker 1** [00:25:14] Sure. Mm hmm. Like your personal interests or preference?</h4>

								<h4>**Speaker 2** [00:25:20] Oh, I don't know,</h4>

								<h4>**Speaker 1** [00:25:23] because it already has bacon a in it.</h4>

								<h4>**Speaker 2** [00:25:26] And that's part of just trying to think of things you can tweak because one of the good things about it is there's not a lot of ingredients bacon, egg, cheese, noodles, rye. There may be a way that you can prepare it with rice. Maybe, maybe and</h4>

								<h4>**Speaker 1** [00:25:42] substitute the pasta.</h4>

								<h4>**Speaker 2** [00:25:44] So yeah, I'm trying to think if you change your starch, you know, maybe you do rice or potatoes instead of your noodle because I can't. I don't think you can change the sauce much. I can't think of a way because then it would be carbonara.</h4>

								<h4>**Speaker 1** [00:26:01] You can. What if you can add something on top of it? I'm trying to think, as you said, potato, and it's hard for me to imagine there's potato like a</h4>

								<h4>**Speaker 2** [00:26:12] gnocchi like instead of doing what's that's not fusion, that's just still Italian. I don't know. I guess I'm American. You can put it over french fries,</h4>

								<h4>**Speaker 1** [00:26:24] french fry or on a pizza.</h4>

								<h4>**Speaker 2** [00:26:27] That would be good. Yeah, pizza. Yeah, carbonara. Pizza Hut it down. I think Naoki would be a thing that would be more interesting to the fusion because you could do it like the Korean rice cake dish instead of the rice cake. It's no deal. And so you would do the Naoki balls like you do Italian, but the sauce would be the straight up rice cake.</h4>

								<h4>**Speaker 1** [00:26:49] Spicy style will be cool. Actually, I can picture that like I'm attracted to.</h4>

								<h4>**Speaker 2** [00:26:55] That makes more</h4>

								<h4>**Speaker 1** [00:26:56] sense to me. Yeah, because Korean rice cake has the. Same texture, yeah, sticky.</h4>

								<h4>**Speaker 2** [00:27:01] Plus, the identity of the gnocchi dish is the potato bowl. It's not so much the sauce or as carbonara. The identity of the dish is the sauce. It's not the it's not the noodle. Yeah, yeah, that's not the most important part. And then same thing with the Korean rice cake dish. You know, it's more about the rice cake.</h4>

								<h4>**Speaker 1** [00:27:19] Yeah, it's on texture. Cool. Cool, cool. Cool. All right. Anything else you want to add on to carbonara related topics? A doll? OK, cool. All right. Well, thank you for your time, Aaron.</h4>

								<h4>**Speaker 2** [00:27:37] You're welcome. All right. </h4>
