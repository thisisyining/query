								<p class="forprint"> Overview </p>
								<h4> I enjoy cooking a lot. I like to cook carbonara, gumbo, steak, and potatoes. My favorite thing to cook is probably steak and potatoes because It's not very difficult, but it's very tasty and filling. Also, just like the taste of beef. </h4>

								<h4> **Speaker 1** [00:00:02] All right. Hi. Hello. Hi, my name's Yining. I'm Aaron. All right. So today we're just going to have a casual conversation. So Aaron, let me ask you, do you like to cook? </h4>
								<h4>**Speaker 1** [00:00:18] What do you usually like to cook? </h4>
								<h4>**Speaker 2** [00:00:20] I like to cook carbonara.</h4>
								<h4>**Speaker 1** [00:00:22] OK, what else?</h4>
								<h4>**Speaker 2** [00:00:24] Gumbo. This could be like, Okay, what else do I like to cook? Steak potatoes? OK?</h4>
								<h4>**Speaker 1** [00:00:34] Do you have a favorite thing to cook?</h4>
								<h4>**Speaker 2** [00:00:38] Probably.</h4>
								<h4>**Speaker 1** [00:00:38] Steak steak was that.</h4>
								<h4>**Speaker 2** [00:00:40] It's not very difficult, but it's very tasty and filling. Also, just like the taste of beef.</h4>
								<h4>**Speaker 1** [00:00:47] So that's fair. And how long does it usually take for you to cook full meal of steak?</h4>
								<h4>**Speaker 2** [00:00:54] The prep time is about two and a half hours, but the majority of that is the steak cooking in a water bath, so I don't have to do anything to actually actual active time. Cooking is more like 10 minutes.</h4>
								<h4>**Speaker 1** [00:01:05] OK? I think from all the meals that you've cooked, um, I think my personal favorite as carbonara. Mm-Hmm.</h4>
