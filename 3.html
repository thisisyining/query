								<h4> The Serafina carbonara was good. I like it. A little more protein. There was a little more mild on that, but it was done well. It was done correctly. The sauce was the correct emulsified egg sauce. A little more thick. The carbonara we had in Jackson was so bad because it was scrambled eggs and spaghetti. It was pretty bad. It doesn't taste like there's any seasoning in it. It's not even I don't taste any salt. It's just like plain. There should be no egg. There should be no egg curds visible in your dish. If you can see egg whites in your spaghetti is not a good third way. </h4>

								<h4>**Speaker 1** [00:18:33] Nice. And I remember we've had carbonara at a restaurant at least twice. I think the most recent one is from that Italian place of Serafina. Yeah, yeah. How do you how do you like there are carbonara there?</h4>

								<h4>**Speaker 2** [00:18:48] Carbonara was good. Yeah. I like it. A little more protein. A little more thick. That could be because I add more bacon and a little more cheese because I really, really, really like that rich, creamy flavor. Mm hmm. There was a little more mild on that, but it was done well. It was done correctly. The sauce was the correct emulsified egg sauce,</h4>

								<h4>**Speaker 1** [00:19:14] and the other time we had a carbonara was in Jackson, Mississippi. And I don't even know if that's the Italian restaurant, but they have carbonara on their menu. I order that. How do you how do you think about their carbonara?</h4>

								<h4>**Speaker 2** [00:19:29] I give them. I can't give them a zero, so I'll give them a one year notice. Yeah, because it was scrambled eggs and spaghetti.</h4>

								<h4>**Speaker 1** [00:19:37] Yeah, it was pretty bad. It doesn't taste like there's any seasoning in it. It's not even I don't taste any salt. It's just like plain.</h4>

								<h4>**Speaker 2** [00:19:46] Yeah, and you're not and you're not going to get that protein flavor because the the emulsified, you know, somewhat undercooked eggs are going to have more of a protein than a scrambled egg. Mm-Hmm. Plus, maybe you could just you could look at it right away and be like, Now,</h4>

								<h4>**Speaker 1** [00:20:01] yeah, they don't.</h4>

								<h4>**Speaker 2** [00:20:02] They don't. There should be no egg. There should be no egg curds visible in your dish. If you can see egg whites in your spaghetti is not a good third way.</h4>

								<h4>**Speaker 1** [00:20:11] Yeah. Oh, do you know what they did wrong the Costa? Or just like everything's</h4>

								<h4>**Speaker 2** [00:20:16] wrong, they incorporate too much heat and when they added the egg mixture to the pan? Mm hmm. OK. Which makes that dish, you know, hard to cook in a restaurant because it needs a lot of attention. You know, if you're a line cook and you have seven frying pans going, I mean, your margin of error for cooking eggs is very, very low, right? Because you have this like delicate dance that you're doing, you don't want it to be too raw, but you don't want it to be curds and overcooked. So and once they're curds, you can't reverse it. You have to start over.</h4>

								<h4>**Speaker 1** [00:20:51] Cool. And um, when you go to a restaurant, you see they have carbonara on their menu. How what are some boxes that need to be checked that you know, it's a good carbonara?</h4>

								<h4>**Speaker 2** [00:21:04] I would like if I were going to order carbonara in an Italian restaurant. I don't want to see a lot of things on the menu.</h4>

								<h4>**Speaker 1** [00:21:11] I don't restaurant's</h4>

								<h4>**Speaker 2** [00:21:12] menu. That's right. So I don't want to see 25 pastas on the menu. You know, I want to see like five, because then I know that, OK, a lot one. A lot of people ordered this carbonara for it sort of be in rotation and to they have a lot of experience cooking it. Mm hmm. You know, if I go and there's twenty five pastas on the menu, I know that, you know, this doesn't get ordered.</h4>

								<h4>**Speaker 1** [00:21:34] You're OK with every possible. They're not great at each true.</h4>

								<h4>**Speaker 2** [00:21:37] And they make cook that once a day. Yeah.</h4>

								<h4>**Speaker 1** [00:21:39] You know, I feel like that applies to just restaurants in general. Yeah. So smaller, but also</h4>

								<h4>**Speaker 2** [00:21:45] have a smaller menu</h4>

								<h4>**Speaker 1** [00:21:50] like when you get the pasta by the look of it. How do you</h4>

								<h4>**Speaker 2** [00:21:53] know? I just don't want to see cooked eggs. I don't want to see a curds in my mouth. My bow. So I sort of feel thing, too. You know, if you go in and the restaurant doesn't feel authentic, you're probably not going to order it. You know, like Olive Garden doesn't have carbonara, but I would never order carbonara from, like a franchise Italian restaurant.</h4>

								<h4>**Speaker 1** [00:22:17] It's true. Would you say carbonara is one of the most difficult like or on the more difficult side of pastas the people can cook?</h4>

								<h4>**Speaker 2** [00:22:27] You know, I'm not sure because I don't I haven't cooked all the pastas. I definitely would say it's not an easy pasta just because of your margin of error. When the eggs you can't, you can't overcook spaghetti bolognese with red sauce. I mean, it'd be difficult to mess that up by overcooking it. Same thing with, like Alfredo, you know, those are two safe choices. Yeah, yeah. I'd say carbonara is a little more technically difficult, but I don't know that it's more difficult than making ravioli, you know, making something that takes a lot of prep work, right? And then once it all that work is done. How do you prepare it and not mess it up? I'm not sure.</h4>

								<h4>**Speaker 1** [00:23:09] And what do you usually cook? I mean, order at the Italian restaurant, do you order on carbonara or something else?</h4>

								<h4>**Speaker 2** [00:23:19] You know, it just kind of depends where I'm at. And then if it was a dinner and not lunch, I would probably order carbonara for dinner. Lunch, I would probably want something lighter. But when I go out to eat, I usually like to eat things that I don't make at home, right? So I'd probably order something with squid or something with clams that I'm just not going to cook at home because I don't want to put the effort into buying a fresh squid or cleaning it. You know, it's there's</h4>

								<h4>**Speaker 1** [00:23:47] just too much for it.</h4>

								<h4>**Speaker 2** [00:23:48] That's a lot more difficult for me because I just don't have experience doing it. And yeah, it's a lot more work. So, yeah, I would probably order something like that. So your clams, squid or just something that I'm craving, you know, like every once while in my crab chicken parmesan? Yeah, yeah. Which isn't like a super authentic, difficult thing to do, but it's it's a very safe choice. Are lasagna Bosnians going to order restaurant? Because I don't want to prepare the lasagna at home?</h4>

								<h4>**Speaker 1** [00:24:19] Yeah, that's too much or too much time, too.</h4>

								<h4>**Speaker 2** [00:24:22] Yeah, or tortellini? I'm not. There's no way I'm going to prepare tortellini.</h4>

								<h4>**Speaker 1** [00:24:28] Would you say Carbonara is your favorite pasta to cook carbonara?</h4>

								<h4>**Speaker 2** [00:24:33] And then a close second would be potato gnocchi.</h4>

								<h4>**Speaker 1** [00:24:38] Oh, OK, yeah. Yeah, that's good. Yeah.</h4>

								<h4>**Speaker 2** [00:24:40] Potato Noack is very good this. It's a little more labor-intensive intensive on the front end, but it's a lot easier to cook than the corridor. Hmm. But it has a very, very good flavor, too nice.</h4>
